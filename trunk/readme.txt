This is a very simple plugin for publishing your wordpress posts to facebook.

== Description ==

This plugin is maybe the most simple implementation of a facebook publishing functionality out there. All it does is adding a checkbox to the post edit screen.
Checking this checkbox will convert your wordpress post into a facebook post which is automatically published on saving/updating the post.

The plugin makes use of the latest facebook api version (PHP SDK 4.4.0).

== Installation ==

You need a facebook app with the following permissions, reviewed by facebook:

- manage_pages
- publish_actions

Also you have to generate a permanent page access token. Click the following link for a tutorial on how to get one: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17197970/facebook-permanent-page-access-token

After installing the plugin got to "Settings" > "Simple Facebook Publish" and enter your app id, app secret and the access token.
Now on the post edit screen you will see an additional meta box with a checkbox. Check this checkbox before saving/updating a post to publish it on facebook.

**ATTENTION:** Your server needs to run php 5.4 or later!
